# PyGeom
###A Python Geometry package for Gemc

This is a package that allows you to author Gemc geometry from a bit of Python code. It allows you to use the full computational prowess of Python and all it's packages to define your geometry and then write out the result as either Gemc txt files, or write to a database, or render the result in ROOT.

The code also allows you to import a Gemc txt file, then view the geometry in ROOT, and write it all out as a skeleton Python code for further manipulation.

Getting started and all that will be added soon.
