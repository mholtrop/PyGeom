    "Note: Python is a highly interactive language and that makes it a lot of fun to work with. You can start a python shell by typing \"python\" at the command line, and follow along step by step. A slightly more convenient python shell is \"ipython\", which has command line completion incorporated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: At Jlab, you have limited ability to install system software your self. Fortunately CC has already installed a modern Python installation with all the scientific Python goodness as a package called Anaconda. This includes ipython and includes the MySQLdb plugin, plus a ton of other good things, see: https://docs.continuum.io/ and https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index. It's free to download to your own system.\n",
    "We get the Anaconda python by adding it to our path. At Jlab, for bash:\n",

    "We are also going to want to use ROOT for allowing us to draw the geometries. This is not needed if you only want to create the TXT files that GEMC uses, but having it really will make the creation of geometries for GEMC easier. \n",
    "So before importing the GeometryROOT package (see below), you will want to have ROOTSYS setup by executing the \"thisroot.sh\" or \"thisroot.tcsh\" script. \n",
